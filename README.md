#scroll-effects
This is a set of javascript utilities that help implement performant scroll event related effects.

`icr.scroller` is the central object that listens to scroll events and to which effect objects (like `icr.parallax`) can subscribe via `onScroll()` handler.

Code is written in pure JS so no dependancy to any js library. It is mobile browsers compatible and works on IE9+.

Please note this project is work in progress.
